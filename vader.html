      <p id="text"> When you simplify something
         you want to have as little as possible but 
         still keeping the characteristic. Vader is such an iconic
         character so you don't need to keep many details to
         still be recognizable. For me is his mouth the most 
         characteristic thing on his helmet, so I started with 
         just keeping that. It was great and you could actually
         recognize him with just the mouth. But I decided
         to add some structure from his helmet aswell
         because it looked way more epic and was still simplified a 
         lot.
